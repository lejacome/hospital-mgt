            Whether somebody needs minor or major surgeries, we provide the best we can. The surgical staff provides excellent hands-on care to the patients and appropriate education to the patient is given to decrease their recovery time.General Surgeons are especially trained to care for patients with complex illnesses, in which the diagnosis may be difficult.<br><?php echo image_tag('general.gif', 'alt=foo size=228x122 align=right') ?> The experienced team of general surgery provides expertise in diagnosis and treatment of problems affecting different body systems in a patient. They are also trained to deal with social and psychological impact of the disease. </p> 
            <p>RMI's surgeons are trained in the most advanced procedures and technologies; they perform a wide range of general surgeries. The following procedures are carried out at RMI: </p> 
            <ul> 
              <li> Cholecystectomy </li> 
              <li>Appendectomy </li>

			 <p><strong>Endoscopic Procedures: </strong></p> 
            <ul> 
              <li>Gastroscopy</li> 
              <li>Colonoscopy</li> 
            </ul> 
            <p>In addition to General Surgical procedures mentioned above, Laparoscopic Surgery has also recently been launched at RMI. </p> 
            <p> <strong>Laparcscopic Surgery: </strong></p> 
            <p align="justify">The laparoscope has radically changed the old order of open surgery to a new era of key-hole surgery. Continued advancements in technology and the skill of surgeons promise to make an even bigger impact in the future. A laparoscope is a narrow tube that can be inserted into the abdominal cavity through a short incision and can be connected to a video monitor. Using a laparoscope and long instruments inserted through 1/4 to 1/2 inch incisions, highly trained and skilled surgeons are able to perform surgical procedures that previously required long incisions and prolonged periods of recovery. Using laparoscopic surgery, operative procedures that previously required extended hospital stays are now frequently performed as outpatient procedures. </p> 
            <p>The main advantages of laparoscopic surgery are :</p> 
            <ul> 
              <li>Minimal hospital stay </li> 
              <li>Small incision </li> 
              <li>No blood loss </li> 
              <li>Negligible scar </li> 
              <li>Early return to work </li> 
            </ul>
